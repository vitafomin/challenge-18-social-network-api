# challenge-18-social-network-api


## Description
  
In this weeks challenge I was tasked to create a API for a social network that uses a NoSQL database. Given the API for the social network you are able to run the server to allow the app to start working. When the server is up and running the connection between the mongoose models and the mongoDb database are synced and established. When the API is opened you are able to see and test all the GET routes for both the users and thoughts. You are able to get all users, all thoughts, a single user, and a single thought. All data is displayed and formatted as JSON. All POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are able to successfully create, update and delete thoughts and users. All POST and DELETE routes are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts, and add and remove friends to a users friend's list.



## Installation

For this application to work you need to have express and mongoose installed.


## Usage

This is a great application for anyone that is looking to handle large amouts of unscructured data, or structured data. This is a great tool to retrieve, create, update, and delete within a database. With this tool you are able get all, get one, add to, remove from, and update within. It is a great app to stay orgainized, and minipulate data however you need.
